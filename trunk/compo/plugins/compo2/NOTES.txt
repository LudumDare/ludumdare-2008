- prev and next buttons, bold current page on view all
- add search button
- cache for results
- add get_user data to entry data in database, and comment data.
- better thumb cache (per compo)
- add search on rate page as well

x- on rate, be able to see least-votedupon entries

===========
- you can add jam entries during rating before locked
- you can not change entry type during rating
- add "rules" as a attribute
- add "gamejam" as a attribute
- check for gamejam in various places where the game jam is mentioned in the code
s
Entry viewing:
    x - you can vote on jam entries

Entry creation
    x - if a URL is invalid, user isn't warned properly (and game isn't marked inactive)
    x - if a user doesn't select an entry type, the user isn't warned properly (and game isn't marked inactive)
        - maybe add etype=whatever and is_judged and get rid of rules_ok
    x - don't allow game names that are just whitespace



Rate submission (minor)
    - have comment detection use a query to find out if they have made comments

TODO:
- add a lockdown feature so that after the compo
tons of new entries can't be added / edited
- allow non-voters to leave comments
- document way for admin to see how many votes entries have
- see suggestions post for more stuffs (written by PoV...)


Just add ?admin=1 to the URL and you can manage entries if you are a WP admin.


fact is, the journal isn't even needed to run a compo ..
so just create a new page ..
and copy in the code from the current page ..

the only thing the journal does - is if a category is included in the "compo tag", then the "view users' journal" link will appear and link to their journal for that category
the 3 compo status are "active","rate" and "results"

[compo2:STATUS:WP_CATEGORY:Cat1;Cat2;Cat3]

STATUS is one of "active", "rate", and "results"

WP_CATEGORY is the category as it appears in links, and this is optional.
