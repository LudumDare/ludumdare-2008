#summary The official TODO list for LD

= ASAP =

  * Move rules and submission guidelines to pages on the wordpress site
  * Reduce wiki use to theme suggestions and general tips and tricks, and not rules and other key info.  A competitor who isn't super involved should never HAVE to go to the wiki, though it might contain useful info.

= IMPORTANT =

  * Game jam stuff features?
  * Better comment features in voting

= WHATEVER =

  * Update our theme
