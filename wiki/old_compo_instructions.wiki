#summary Instructions on how the old-compo plugin works

= OLD COMPO INSTRUCTIONS BELOW =

These are mainly in case we need to do some maint. on some ancient compo stuff ..

= Starting it =

  # update the countdown
  # set Compo > Admin > Settings > Writing > change default category to that so all posts get dropped in there magically
  # make a blog post announcing the starting theme
  # send a message to the mailing list

= Ending it =

  # Change the countdown to 14 days later so people have time to judge
  # enable Judging in Compo > Admin > Settings > Compo > 
    set up the current category to be in "Rate" mode and have a list of the categories being       
    judged there.
  # Modify Compo > Admin > Pages > Status to have a link to the judging page
    The link will be http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/category/$category/
  # You might also want to link to a cool grid page http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/category/$category/?tag=final+final&mythumb_nav=1

= Revealing Results =
  
  # disable Judging in in Compo > Admin > Settings > Compo > 
    set the current category to results mode.
  # modify the Compo > Admin > Pages > Status > to say who the top few winners of the overall category were.
