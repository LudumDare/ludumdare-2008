#summary Stuff about how to run a contest

= Introduction =

Add your content here.  Or not.

= Announcing it =

  # create a category for it "ld14" or whatever - for mini compos, create a sub category of the mini category
  # e-mail the gamecompo.com mailing list of course!
  # make a blog post announcing the upcoming contest (as user=news)
  # For a big compo, copy the previous compo's wiki to a new folder and update some links so that each compo gets its own wiki.  More specific instructions to be added.

= The Countdown = 

  # Modify https://ludumdare.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/compo/themes/ludum/countdown.php
  # SSH to the site
  # $ cd (something)/compo/wp-content/themes/ludum 
  # $ svn update

= Theme Voting =

  # Create a new wordpress "page" per day of theme voting
  # Fill that page with the theme voting tag as follows.  To start voting:

{{{
[compo-vote:open:theme1;theme 2;theme 3]
}}}

  * To show the results of voting:

{{{
[compo-vote:closed:theme1;theme 2;theme 3]
}}}


= Starting it =

  # set Compo > Admin > Settings > Writing > change default category to that so all posts get dropped in there magically
  # make a blog post announcing the starting theme
  # send a message to the mailing list

= Ending it =

  # Change the countdown to 14 days later so people have time to judge
  # enable Judging in Compo > Admin > Settings > Compo > 
    set up the current category to be in "Rate" mode and have a list of the categories being       
    judged there.
  # Modify Compo > Admin > Pages > Status to have a link to the judging page
    The link will be http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/category/$category/
  # You might also want to link to a cool grid page http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/category/$category/?tag=final+final&mythumb_nav=1

= Revealing Results =
  
  # disable Judging in in Compo > Admin > Settings > Compo >
