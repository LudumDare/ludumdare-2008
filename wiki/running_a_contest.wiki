#summary Stuff about how to run a contest

= Introduction =

Add your content here.  Or not.

= Announcing it =

  # create a category for it "ld14" or whatever - for mini compos, create a sub category of the mini category
  # e-mail the gamecompo.com mailing list of course!
  # make a blog post announcing the upcoming contest (as user=news)
  # For a big compo, copy the previous compo's wiki to a new folder and update some links so that each compo gets its own wiki.  More specific instructions to be added.

= The Countdown = 

  # Modify https://ludumdare.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/compo/themes/ludum/countdown.php
  # SSH to the site
  # $ cd (something)/compo/wp-content/themes/ludum 
  # $ svn update

= Theme Voting =

  # Create a new wordpress "page" per day of theme voting
  # Fill that page with the theme voting tag as follows.  To start voting:

{{{
[compo-vote:open:theme1;theme 2;theme 3]
}}}

  * To show the results of voting:

{{{
[compo-vote:closed:theme1;theme 2;theme 3]
}}}

= Starting a Compo =

 # Create a new wordpress page for the compo
 # Put in a tag 
{{{
[compo2 state="active" jcat="ld234" cats="Innovation;Fun;Overall"]
}}}
 # STATE is "active" at start
 # JCAT is optional, but can refer to the wp-category slug that is being used by contestants to journal in.
 # CATS should be a semi-colon delimited list of voting categories "Fun;Innovation;Production;Theme" 
 # LOCKED should be 0 or 1.  If set to 1, it will stop users from adding new entries.  Existing users can still edit their existing entries.
 # RULES should be a URL to a page with rules if this is a contest where being judged vs just jamming is an option.

= Rating Entries =
 # Change the STATE to "rate"

= Viewing Results =
 # Change the STATE to "results"

= Closed Compos =
 # Change the STATE to "closed"
This is only used for compos that are not being judged.  It merely closes the compo from adding new entries.

= Admin =
 # Click on the "Enter admin mode" link.  It will let you modify and disable entries.
