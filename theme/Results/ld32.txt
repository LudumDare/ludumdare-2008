isn't it ironic?
it can only be used once
It does not take much
It doesn't get any easier
it doesn't ring a bell
it has different shapes
It is a lie
It is exactly what it looks like
it is not green
It Isn't
It just keeps on going
It makes a difference
It must go on
it never ends
It Never Happened That Way
It Spreads
It started with a bang
It was all a dream
It was fun while it lasted
It was only your Imagination
It will be a good day
It's a miracle
It's A Party
It's A Trap!
It's about seeing past the chaff.
It's alive!
It's All In How You Perceive It
It's all relative
It's Dangerous to go Alone
it's dangerous to go alone, take this
It's getting warmer
It's gonna explode!
It's hard to raise the dead
It's lonely at the top
It's melting!
It's Mine
It's not about you for once
It's not Omniscience
It's not what you think
It's Not You, It's Me
It's not your turn
It's not your turn yet
It's only for the weak
It's Raining Cats and Dogs
It's safer outside
It's the law
It's what's on the inside that counts
It´s more beautiful than I ever imagend
It´s the 80s!
